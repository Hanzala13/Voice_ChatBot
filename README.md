# Voice_ChatBot
The Voice Chatbot is an interactive application that combines voice recognition and text-to-speech technologies to create a conversational experience. This chatbot listens to the user's spoken input, processes the input to determine an appropriate response, and then responds in both text and spoken formats.

Built using Python, the application leverages libraries like speech_recognition for capturing and interpreting speech, pyttsx3 for generating voice responses, and tkinter for creating a user-friendly graphical interface. It provides a seamless way to interact with users through voice, making it ideal for applications like customer support, virtual assistants, or accessibility tools for users who prefer or require voice-based interaction.

The project demonstrates the integration of multiple technologies to create an engaging and dynamic user experience, showcasing how voice-based applications can be developed for various real-world scenarios.

# Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Listens to and recognizes user speech.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text responses into spoken words.
- **Graphical Interface**: Easy-to-use interface built with `tkinter`.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **tkinter**: Python library for creating the GUI.
- **speech_recognition**: Python library for speech recognition.
- **pyttsx3**: Python library for text-to-speech conversion.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hanzala13/voice_ChatBot.git
   cd voice-chatbot

Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
`pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio`
Note: On some systems, installing pyaudio might require additional setup. Refer to the PyAudio documentation for more details.

Usage
Run the script:
`python voice_chatbot.py`
Click the "Start" button in the application window.

Speak into your microphone. The chatbot will listen to your input, process it, and provide a spoken response.

Code Overview
1. Text-to-Speech Initialization
The application initializes a text-to-speech engine using pyttsx3:

python
Copy code
engine = pyttsx3.init()
2. Function Definitions
speak_text(text): Converts the provided text into speech.
recognize_speech(): Captures user voice input using a microphone and converts it to text.
process_response(text): Generates a simple response based on the user's input.
3. GUI Setup
The GUI is created using tkinter, with elements like the main window, chat frame, text box for conversation display, and a start button.

4. Running the Application
The application runs an event loop to keep the GUI active:

python
Copy code
app.mainloop()
Future Improvements
Add more complex response logic and integrate with external APIs for enhanced functionality.
Improve error handling and user feedback for speech recognition.
Add more interactive GUI elements for better user experience.

# Voice Chatbot Application

A simple voice-activated chatbot application built with Python. This application listens to user input through the microphone, processes the input to generate an appropriate response, and then provides the response in both text and speech form.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Uses microphone input to capture and recognize speech.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Converts chatbot responses from text to spoken words.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with `tkinter` for easy interaction.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-chatbot.git
   cd voice-chatbot
Install the Required Libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If you don't have a requirements.txt, create one with the following content:

Copy code
SpeechRecognition
pyttsx3
pyaudio
tkinter
Important: Installing pyaudio may require additional steps depending on your operating system. Refer to PyAudio documentation for detailed instructions.

Usage
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
python voice_chatbot.py
Interact with the Chatbot:

Click the "Start" button in the GUI window.
Speak into your microphone.
The chatbot will listen, recognize your speech, and respond accordingly.
Project Structure
voice_chatbot.py: Main script containing the logic for speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and GUI management.
How It Works
Initialize Text-to-Speech Engine:

The application uses pyttsx3 to initialize a text-to-speech engine that converts text responses into speech.
Speech Recognition:

The recognize_speech() function uses the speech_recognition library to listen to the user’s voice input and convert it to text.
Processing User Input:

The process_response(text) function generates responses based on recognized input (e.g., responds with a greeting if the user says "hello").
Graphical User Interface:

The GUI is built using tkinter and includes a chat window, a status label, and a start button for user interaction.
Screenshots

Future Enhancements
Expand response logic for more diverse conversations.
Integrate external APIs (e.g., weather, news) to provide dynamic responses.
Add more advanced error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
